# Drone Visibility Analysis Tools üöÅ

A comprehensive Python toolkit for analyzing drone visibility from ground observation points using Digital Surface Models (DSM). The toolkit includes two complementary analysis methods: fixed-angle ray casting and dynamic drone-target visibility calculation.
## Introduction

Modern drone operations require a nuanced understanding of what the pilot can actually see from the ground. Terrain slope, tree cover, and flight height all affect line-of-sight visibility, which can have critical implications for safety, RC strength, and operational compliance.

Drone Visibility Analysis Tools is designed to simulate and evaluate what‚Äôs visible from the pilot‚Äôs perspective. Use it for planning, compliance, or simply to gain spatial insight into how your environment affects visual connections to the sky.

## Features

### Core Capabilities
- **Ray-casting visibility analysis**: Determines line-of-sight visibility areas
- **Spatial polygon generation**: Creates visibility polygons showing observable areas

### Two Analysis Modes

#### 1. **Fixed-Angle Analysis** (`SpatialDroneVisibilityAnalyzer`)
- Casts rays at a specified elevation angle (e.g., 5¬∞) in all directions
- Identifies terrain obstacles blocking the line of sight
- Creates visibility polygons showing observable areas at fixed angles
- Useful for regulatory sky visibility checks

#### 2. **Drone-Target Analysis** (`DroneAngleVisibilityAnalyzer`)
- Calculates the actual angle needed to see a drone at specific positions
- Places drones at target distances and heights above ground level
- **Adaptive positioning**: Automatically moves drone closer if not visible
- Perfect for flight planning and operational scenarios

## Key Differences Between Analysis Modes

| Feature                    | **Fixed-Angle Analyzer**                | **Drone-Target Analyzer**                                               |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Elevation Angle**       | Fixed (e.g., 5¬∞ from staging point)     | Computed dynamically using observer ‚Üí drone geometry                    |
| **Drone Position**        | Not modeled                             | Y meters above terrain (at each location)                               |
| **Drone Elevation Source**| Not applicable                          | Min elevation in a 5m radius buffer under each candidate drone location |
| **Visibility Criterion**  | Beam intersects terrain at fixed angle  | Line-of-sight to drone is blocked by terrain along the path             |
| **Use Case**              | Regulatory angle checks                 | Realistic flight line-of-sight modeling for actual drone routes         |
| **Output**                | Polygon of visible sky from fixed angle | Polygon of areas where drone is visible from ground observer            |
| **Adaptive Mode**         | NA                                      | Move drone closer until visible                                         |

## üîç Understanding the Difference: Sky Visibility vs. Drone Visibility

![Sky vs Drone Visibility Analysis](examples/drone_sky_visibility.png)

The image above illustrates the fundamental difference between our two analysis methods using real terrain data:

### Terrain Context
- **Eastern area**: Uphill terrain (higher elevation)
- **Western area**: Valley approximately 200m below the hilltop
- **Staging point**: Located on the mid-slope (drone operator position)

### Key Visibility Scenarios

The analysis reveals two critical scenarios that demonstrate why both tools are necessary:

#### üî¥ Point 1: Sky Not Visible, Drone Visible
- **Location**: Uphill (eastern) direction
- **Sky visibility (5¬∞ angle)**: ‚ùå Blocked by rising terrain
- **Drone visibility**: ‚úÖ Visible flying 120m above the slope
- **Why**: The drone flies high enough above the terrain to be seen over the hill, even though the 5¬∞ sky view is blocked

#### üü¢ Point 2: Sky Visible, Drone Not Visible  
- **Location**: Downhill (western) direction toward the valley
- **Sky visibility (5¬∞ angle)**: ‚úÖ Clear view above horizon
- **Drone visibility**: ‚ùå Not visible despite clear sky
- **Why**: The drone at 120m AGL is actually below the observer's line of sight due to the steep downward slope

### Why This Matters

This comparison demonstrates that:
- **Fixed-angle analysis** (5¬∞ sky visibility) doesn't predict actual drone visibility
- **Drone-target analysis** accounts for terrain elevation changes and actual drone position
- In foothill terrain, a drone can be visible when flying uphill despite blocked sky views
- Conversely, clear sky visibility doesn't guarantee drone visibility in valleys

![Sky vs Drone Visibility Analysis](examples/drone_sky_visibility_2.png)

The image demonstrates a compound visibility challenge: while slope (uphill or downhill) affects line-of-sight geometry, tall trees to the southwest of the staging area further obstruct views to both the sky and the drone.

**Bottom line**: For safe drone operations, you need to analyze actual drone positions, not just sky visibility angles.

   ```

## üìñ Quick Start

### Fixed-Angle Analysis

Configure your analysis parameters in `config/angle.yaml`:
```yaml
paths:
  dsm_path: /path/to/your/dsm.tif
  staging_gpkg: /path/to/staging_points.gpkg
  output_gpkg: /path/to/output.gpkg

params:
  drone_height_agl: 120.0  # Drone height above ground level (meters)
  elevation_angle: 5.0     # Elevation angle for ray casting (degrees)
  max_distance: 3000       # Maximum analysis distance (meters)
  num_rays: 360           # Number of rays (360 = 1¬∞ increments)
```

Run analysis:
```bash
python main_sky_angle.py
```

### Drone-Target Analysis

Configure parameters in `config/angle.yaml`:
```yaml
drone_params:
  drone_distance: 2000.0      # Target distance to place drone
  drone_height_agl: 120.0     # Drone height above ground level
  adaptive_positioning: true  # Enable adaptive positioning
  step_back: 200.0           # Distance to move closer if not visible
  min_distance: 100.0        # Minimum distance to try
```

Run analysis:
```bash
python main_drone_angle.py
```

## üîç How It Works

### Fixed-Angle Analysis Algorithm
1. **Loading staging points**: Reads observation points from a GeoPackage file
2. **Ray casting**: For each point, casts rays at the specified elevation angle in all directions
3. **Obstruction detection**: Finds where each ray intersects with terrain (considering obstruction depth)

### Drone-Target Analysis Algorithm
1. **Drone placement**: Positions drone at target distance and height above ground level
2. **Terrain sampling**: Uses minimum elevation in 5m buffer for realistic drone positioning
3. **Angle calculation**: Computes angle from observer (1.7m eye height) to drone
4. **Line-of-sight check**: Traces ray from observer to drone checking for obstructions
5. **Adaptive positioning** (if enabled):
   - If blocked, moves drone closer by `step_back` distance
   - Repeats until visible or minimum distance reached

### Algorithm Details
- **Observer height**: 1.7m above ground (eye level)
- **Depth checking**: Obstructions must span multiple pixels to be considered valid (avoids noise)
- **No-data handling**: DSM no-data values are handled gracefully
- **Terrain buffer**: Drone-target mode uses 5m radius minimum elevation for stability

## üìä Output

Both tools generate GeoPackage files with multiple layers:

### Staging Points Layer
- `staging_id`: Unique identifier
- `cluster`: Cluster assignment (if available)
- `staging_elev`: Ground elevation at point
- Analysis parameters

### Visibility Zones Layer
- Visibility polygons
- `visibility_area_ha`: Area in hectares
- `elevation_angle`: Angle used for analysis (fixed-angle mode)
- `mean_angle_deg`: Average angle to drone (drone-target mode)
- `percent_rays_clear`: Percentage of unobstructed rays (drone-target mode)
- `adaptation_pct`: Percentage of rays requiring closer positioning (adaptive mode)

### Batch Analysis

```bash
# Test multiple angles
python src/main.py --multirun params.elevation_angle=5,10,15,20

# Test multiple drone distances
python main_drone_angle.py --multirun drone_params.drone_distance=1000,2000,3000,4000
```
