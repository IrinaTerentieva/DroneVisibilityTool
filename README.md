# Drone Visibility Analysis Tool üöÅ

A Python tool for analyzing drone visibility from ground observation points using Digital Surface Models (DSM). The tool casts rays at specified elevation angles to determine line-of-sight visibility areas, helping optimize drone flight paths and observation point placement.

## Features

- **Ray-casting visibility analysis**: Casts rays at specified elevation angles to find terrain obstructions
- **Spatial polygon generation**: Creates visibility polygons showing observable areas
- **Cluster-aware analysis**: Maintains staging point cluster information throughout analysis
- **GeoPackage export**: Outputs results in QGIS-compatible format
- **Configurable parameters**: Uses Hydra for flexible configuration management
- **Depth-checking algorithm**: Validates obstructions to avoid false positives from single pixels

## Installation

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- GDAL libraries installed on your system

## Quick Start

Configure your analysis parameters in configs/angle.yaml:

```
paths:
  dsm_path: /path/to/your/dsm.tif
  staging_gpkg: /path/to/staging_points.gpkg
  output_gpkg: /path/to/output.gpkg

params:
  drone_height_agl: 120.0  # Drone height above ground level (meters)
  elevation_angle: 5.0     # Elevation angle for ray casting (degrees)
  max_distance: 3000       # Maximum analysis distance (meters)
  num_rays: 360           # Number of rays (360 = 1¬∞ increments)
```

## How It Works
The tool analyzes drone visibility by:

Loading staging points: Reads observation points from a GeoPackage file
Ray casting: For each point, casts rays at the specified elevation angle in all directions
Obstruction detection: Finds where each ray intersects with terrain (considering obstruction depth)
Polygon creation: Connects intersection points to create visibility polygons
Export: Saves results as GeoPackage layers with cluster information preserved

### Algorithm Details

Elevation Angle: Rays are cast upward at the specified angle from observer eye level (1.7m above ground)
Depth Checking: Obstructions must span multiple pixels to be considered valid (avoids noise)
No-data Handling: DSM no-data values are handled gracefully
The tool generates a GeoPackage with two layers:

staging_points: Original observation points with metadata

staging_id: Unique identifier
cluster: Cluster assignment (if available)
staging_elev: Ground elevation at point


visibility_zones_5deg: Visibility polygons

staging_id: Links to staging points
cluster: Cluster assignment
visibility_area_ha: Area in hectares
elevation_angle: Angle used for analysis

### üìè What‚Äôs Different: Fixed-Angle vs. Drone-Target Visibility

| Feature                    | **Fixed-Angle Analyzer**                                     | **Drone-Target Analyzer**                                                   |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Elevation Angle**       | Fixed (e.g., 5¬∞ from staging point)                           | Computed dynamically using observer ‚Üí drone geometry                        |
| **Drone Position**        | Not modeled                                                   | Y meters above terrain (at each location)                                   |
| **Drone Elevation Source**| Not applicable                                                | Min elevation in a 5‚ÄØm radius buffer under each candidate drone location    |
| **Visibility Criterion**  | Beam intersects terrain at fixed angle                        | Line-of-sight to drone is blocked by terrain along the path                |
| **Use Case**              | Regulatory angle checks, worst-case envelope                 | Realistic flight line-of-sight modeling for actual drone routes             |
| **Terrain Sampling**      | Single pixel per ray step                                     | Uses a local terrain minimum in 5‚ÄØm radius under drone position             |
| **Beam Type**             | Fixed-angle beam casting                                      | Dynamic beam toward target location                                         |
| **Output**                | Polygon of visible areas from fixed angle                     | Polygon of areas where drone is visible from ground observer                |

## Drone visibility above terrain:
We're designing a second analyzer where visibility is not based on a fixed elevation angle, but instead on a dynamic angle to the drone at each point along a ray.

Here‚Äôs a summary of what you need to implement:
‚úÖ Goal

Simulate line-of-sight from the controller to the drone, where:

    The controller is at a known location on the ground (staging point + observer height).

    The drone is located Y meters above the terrain, and the terrain height is dynamically calculated as the minimum elevation within a 5‚ÄØm buffer at the (x, y) location along the ray.

    The beam angle is not fixed, but computed dynamically as the angle to the drone at each step along the ray.

## Usage Instructions:

1. Clone and setup:
```
git clone <your-repo>
cd drone-visibility-analysis
pip install -e .
```

2. Configure analysis:
Edit configs/angle/default.yaml with your paths and parameters

3. Run analysis:
```
python src/main.py
```

4. Run with overrides:
```
python src/main.py params.elevation_angle=10 params.max_distance=5000
```

5. Run multiple configurations:
```
python src/main.py --multirun params.elevation_angle=5,10,15
```
